## Assumptions

- The optical MAC energy is treated as delivered optical energy per multiply-accumulate.
- The laser wall-plug efficiency converts delivered optical energy into electrical laser energy.
- ADC conversions are counted once per output element.
- DAC conversions are counted once per input value for the left and right matmul operands.
- Detector energy is counted once per output sample.
- The first noise model combines ADC quantization RMS, phase noise RMS, and drift RMS as independent terms.
- Total latency is a transparent sum of DAC, optical, and ADC latency rather than a pipelined throughput model.
- The benchmark models 1 operation(s) per batch.
- Vector DAC conversions are counted as ceil(batch_size / vector_reuse_factor) * m * k.
- Weight DAC conversions are counted every 1 operation(s).
- The pipeline model reports single-operation latency, total batch latency including fill/drain, and steady-state throughput from the configured cycle time.
- Interface memory traffic is estimated from vector/weight DAC load counts, ADC output sample counts, and converter bit widths; it is not a full memory hierarchy simulation.
