simulation.

## Multi-Tier System Movement

These rows add an explicit local system movement estimate on top of the
photonic core/converter model. SRAM, intermediate, and off-chip traffic are
cumulative tier movements, not published measurements and not a cache
simulator.

## Assumptions

- The optical MAC energy is treated as delivered optical energy per multiply-accumulate.
- The laser wall-plug efficiency converts delivered optical energy into electrical laser energy.
- ADC conversions are counted once per output element.
- DAC conversions are counted once per input value for the left and right matmul operands.
- Detector energy is counted once per output sample.
- The first noise model combines ADC quantization RMS, phase noise RMS, and drift RMS as independent terms.
- Total latency is a transparent sum of DAC, optical, and ADC latency rather than a pipelined throughput model.
- Profile sensitivity card; component, timing, and noise assumptions match the starter 64x64 card.
- The pcie_attached profile is a local modeling preset, not a measured hardware configuration.
- The benchmark models 1 operation(s) per batch.
- Vector DAC conversions are counted as ceil(batch_size / vector_reuse_factor) * m * k.
- Weight DAC conversions are counted every 1 operation(s).
- The pipeline model reports single-operation latency, total batch latency including fill/drain, and steady-state throughput from the configured cycle time.
- Interface memory traffic is estimated from vector/weight DAC load counts, ADC output sample counts, and converter bit widths; it is not a full memory hierarchy simulation.
- The multi-tier system model adds explicit SRAM, intermediate/cache, and off-chip movement energy/timing estimates to the local photonic core/converter energy; tier values are local assumptions, not published measurements.
